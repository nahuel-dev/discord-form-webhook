The design of the form and the page are inspired by the original design of the discord, this to create a real concept of a discord form and that users are familiar with the concept of discord as well.

### CSS and HTML
everything is in one html file, so there is no need to create a separate css or javascript file. Just by uploading the file anywhere on the internet or opening it as an .html file, the form will be available to be used, although you can also separate the code and make a cleaner code. feel free to do it
